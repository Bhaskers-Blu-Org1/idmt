1) First, you need access to the zip file that JZOS is distributed in.  You can download it here: http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/zosjavabatchtk/download

2) This zip file contains a file named jzos.pax.  FTP this file to Unix System Services in binary mode.  FTP the file to the directory where you would like JZOS installed.

3) Change to the directory where you placed the .pax file.

4) Run the command: pax -rvf 
This will created a subdirectory called jzos under the directory that you are in.  This subdirectory will be referred to as <JZOS_HOME>.

5) In the user's home directory, create a file named .profile that looks like this:

export CLPHOME=/usr/lpp/db2/db2910/db2910_base/lib/IBM                  
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/lpp/db2/db2910/db2910_base/lib/clp.jar 
export CLPPROPERTIESFILE=$HOME/clp.properties                           
export LIBPATH=$LIBPATH:<JZOS_HOME>                               
alias db2="java com.ibm.db2.clp.db2"   

CLPHOME and CLASSPATH may have to be modified slightly depending on the environment.  Replace <JZOS_HOME> with the appropriate directory.

6) In the user's home directory, create a file name clp.properties that looks like this:

#Specify the value as ON/OFF or leave them blank              
DisplaySQLCA=ON                                               
AutoCommit=ON                                                 
InputFilename=                                                
OutputFilename=                                               
DisplayOutput=                                                
StopOnError=                                                  
TerminationChar=                                              
Echo=                                                         
StripHeaders=                                                 
MaxLinesFromSelect=                                           
MaxColumnWidth=20                                             
IsolationLevel=                                               
<SUBSYSTEM_NAME>=<IP address>:<port number>/<location name>,USER,PASSWD

Replace items on the last line as appropriate.

7) Run the command chmod 777 <JZOS_HOME>/*.so
